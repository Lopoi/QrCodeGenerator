# QrCode Generator

A simple gui for generating QR Codes.

![Example](https://github.com/lopoi/QrCodeGenerator/blob/main/example.png?raw=true)

## Why did you make this?

Mostly cause I'm tired of using websites to generate QR Code and cause I wanted to see how [Tauri Apps](https://tauri.app/) works, but most importantly cause my gf asked me to.

## Why no Linux/Mac distribution

Well, linux users are used to using bash commands, so there is plenty libraries for them all around github (like this one I found on google: [libqrencode](https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode))

I don't have a mac.

## What's next?

I'm pretty much done with this app, though if [qrcode.react](https://github.com/zpao/qrcode.react) gets updated with new funcitonality I may revisit this project to implement them in a easier way.

That said, there are things I could do right now, such as:

- [ ] Add more export formats
- [ ] Add more languages (you should contribute that if you want)
- [ ] Maybe add light mode? (ugh...)

## Contributing
Just make a pull request and I will evaluate your additions (Don't expect me to be quick).
